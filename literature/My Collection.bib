abstract = {Using three taxonomic groups of beetles we examine how alpha and beta diversity influence the species richness of a landscape (gamma diversity), and vice versa. That is, how the species richness of a  landscape – which is a historical and biogeographical phenomenon –  contributes to the values of alpha diversity (1) at a given site, (2) in a community, (3) in terms of cumulative species richness by community, and also contributes to (4) the intensity of species exchange between  communities. To explore this question, we used two subfamilies of  Scarabaeoidea: Scarabaeinae and Geotrupinae, and the family  Silphidae. In all analyses these three taxonomic groups are considered  as a single indicator group: the copronecrophagous beetles.  Information is also included on the subfamily Aphodiinae  (Scarabaeoidea), coprophagous beetles not included in the indicator  group. Several types of vegetation located in three landscapes (tropical, transition and mountain) were studied, and these are located along an  altitudinal gradient in the central part of the state of Veracruz, Mexico.  We base this study on the following concepts. The alpha diversity of an  indicator group reflects the number of species that use a given  environment or resource in a given place or community. Spacial beta  diversityis related to the response of organisms to spatial  heterogeneity. Gamma diversity depends primarily on the historical and  geographic processes that operate on the mesoscale level and is  also affected by alpha and beta diversity. It is on this scale of landscape  that human actions, such as the modification and fragmentation of  vegetation, have their most important effects. These are, however, often  beyond the scope of ecological analyses carried out on a local  scale. In the three landscapes, sampling was carried out regularly at 67  sites, with complementary sampling at another 69 sites. Twenty-six  types of vegetation communities were studied. A total of 16,152  specimens representing 60 species were captured (52 species of  Scarabaeinae, 4 Geotrupinae and 4 Silphidae). In the tropical landscape  the community richest in species was low deciduous forest. In the  transition landscape, cloud forest was the richest. Each of these  communities is the most representative of their respective altitudinal  bands. In contrast, the greatest species richness in the mountain  landscape occurred in the mountain grasslands and pastures; types of  community favoured by or even created by human intervention. This is  explained by the expansion of heliophilous species from the Mexican  High Plateau into these areas. In the tropical landscape the species  richness of the pastures is similar to that of its forests, but with a  partially different composition which is characterized by the dominance  of heliophilous and coprophagous species; the latter, in addition to the  more ubiquitous species that are shared with the tropical forest. In the  transition landscape the cloud forest and the coffee plantations with  polyspecific shade are important in the context of conserving the fauna. This type of community offers arboreal cover and occupies the majority  of this landscape, allowing the groups of insects studied to move  between remnant fragments of cloud forest. On the landscape scale but  not locally, the fragmentation of natural communities does not  appear to have reduced the number of species for the beetles of the  indicator group. In each landscape disturbance by human activity  appears to have been overcome for distinct reasons. In the tropical  landscape we find the heliophilous beetle fauna characteristic of  pastures, and this has increased by two species of recent invaders. In  the transition landscape, the coffee plantations with polyspecific shade  create a communication matrix, while in the mountain landscape the  expansion of the mountain pastures has made conditions more  favourable for heliophilous species. These results are not necessarily  expected for other groups of organisms. },

abstract = {Beta diversity is an important concept used to describe turnover in species composition across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and it underpins much of conservation theory and practice. Although substantial progress has been made in the mathematical and terminological treatment of different measures of beta diversity, there has been little conceptual synthesis of potential scale dependence of beta diversity with increasing spatial grain and geographic extent of sampling. Here, we evaluate different conceptual approaches to the spatial scaling of beta diversity, interpreted from 'fixed' and 'varying' perspectives of spatial grain and extent. We argue that a 'sliding window' perspective, in which spatial grain and extent covary, is an informative way to conceptualize community differentiation across scales. This concept more realistically reflects the varying empirical approaches that researchers adopt in field sampling and the varying scales of landscape perception by different organisms. Scale dependence in beta diversity has broad implications for emerging fields in ecology and biogeography, such as the integration of fine-resolution ecogenomic data with large-scale macroecological studies, as well as for guiding appropriate management responses to threats to biodiversity operating at different spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation: I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion: Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

However, disturbance-driven changes may be mediated by environmental conditions that affect habitat quality and species interactions. In a decade-long field experiment, we tested how kelp forest net primary productivity (NPP) responds to repeated canopy loss along a gradient in grazing and substrate suitability. We discovered that habitat quality can mediate the effects of intensified disturbance on canopy and understory NPP. Experimental annual and quarterly disturbances suppressed total macroalgal NPP, but effects were strongest in high-quality habitats that supported dense kelp canopies that were removed by disturbance. Understory macroalgae partly compensated for canopy NPP losses and this effect magnified with increasing habitat quality. Disturbance-driven increases in understory NPP were still rising after 5–10 years of disturbance, demonstrating the value of long-term experimentation for understanding ecosystem responses to changing disturbance regimes.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Monitoring understory plant diversity is important, allowing managers to track current diversity status and trends both spatially and temporally at a landscape-scale. Improving precision in quantifying patterns in understory plant diversity improves efficiency in monitoring design and more accurate measures of success of management intervention over time. Patterns of species diversity are dependent upon the scale in which they are examined – an increase in small-scale diversity across a gradient can convert to a decrease in large-scale diversity across that same gradient. Using two extensive datasets including both mined historical data and supplemental experimental data, we performed an additive partitioning of plant diversity to elucidate the hierarchical spatial patterns of understory plant species richness, and independent measures of alpha and beta diversity in the species-rich longleaf pine ecosystem at Eglin Air Force Base in northwestern FL, USA. This analysis allowed us to identify the spatial scale that most effectively captures plant diversity to inform monitoring efforts by using measures of species turnover, specifically beta diversity. We found that while species richness and alpha diversity increased with spatial scale, beta diversity began to reach an asymptote at smaller (1 m2) scales. Furthermore, we found the sampling effort at this 1 m2 scale required as few as 60 plots to effectively estimate plant diversity within management blocks. While our results are attributable to Eglin AFB specifically, these scaling analyses can help to streamline monitoring efforts in other ecosystems that seek to elucidate the individual contributions of diversity components.},

Longleaf pine ecosystems are not only resilient to frequent fire disturbance, but this feature sustains biodiversity. We examined how fire frequency maintains beta diversity of multi-trophic interactions in longleaf pine ecosystems, as this community property provides a measure of functional redundancy of an ecosystem. We found that beta interaction diversity at small local scales is highest in the most frequently burned stands, conferring immediate resiliency to disturbance by fire. Interactions become more specialized and less resilient as fire frequency decreases. Local scale patterns of interaction diversity contribute to broader scale patterns and confer long-termecosystem resiliency. Such natural disturbances are likely to be important for maintaining regional diversity of interactions for a broad range of ecosystems.},

abstract = {For numerous taxa, species richness is much higher in tropical than in temperate zone habitats. A major challenge in community ecology and evolutionary biogeography is to reveal the mechanisms underlying these differences. For herbivorous insects, one such mechanism leading to an increased number of species in a given locale could be increased ecological specialization, resulting in a greater proportion of insect species occupying narrow niches within a community. We tested this hypothesis by comparing host specialization in larval Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) at eight different New World forest sites ranging in latitude from 15° S to 55° N. Here we show that larval diets of tropical Lepidoptera are more specialized than those of their temperate forest counterparts: tropical species on average feed on fewer plant species, genera and families than do temperate caterpillars. This result holds true whether calculated per lepidopteran family or for a caterpillar assemblage as a whole. As a result, there is greater turnover in caterpillar species composition (greater Β diversity) between tree species in tropical faunas than in temperate faunas. We suggest that greater specialization in tropical faunas is the result of differences in trophic interactions; for example, there are more distinct plant secondary chemical profiles from one tree species to the next in tropical forests than in temperate forests as well as more diverse and chronic pressures from natural enemy communities. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Multitrophic interactions play key roles in the origin and maintenance of species diversity, and the study of these interactions has contributed to important theoretical advances in ecology and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, most biodiversity inventories focus on static species lists, and prominent theories of diversity still ignore trophic interactions. The lack of a simple interaction metric that is analogous to species richness is one reason why diversity of interactions is not examined as a response or predictor variable in diversity studies. Using plant-herbivore-enemy trophic chains as an example, we develop a simple metric of diversity in which richness, diversity indices (e.g., Simpson's 1/D), and rarefaction diversity are calculated with links as the basic unit rather than species. Interactions include all two-link (herbivore-plant and enemy-herbivore) and three-link (enemy-herbivore-plant) chains found in a study unit. This metric is different from other indices, such as traditional diversity measures, connectivity and interaction diversity in food-web studies, and the diversity of interaction index in behavioral studies, and it is easier to compute. Using this approach to studying diversity provides novel insight into debates about neutrality and correlations between diversity, stability, productivity, and ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

abstract = {Aims Environmental gradients are drivers of species diversity; however, we know relatively little about the evolutionary processes underlying these relationships. A potentially powerful approach to studying diversity gradients is to quantify the phylogenetic structure within and between assemblages arrayed along broad spatial and environmental gradients. Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages along an environmental gradient with the expectation that the habitat specialization of entire lineages is an important evolutionary pattern influencing the structure of tree communities along environmental gradients. Methods We evaluated the effect of several environmental variables on the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages in 145 plots distributed in northwestern South America that cover a broad environmental gradient. The phylogenetic alpha diversity was quantified for each plot and the phylogenetic beta diversity between each pair of plots was also quantified. Both the alpha and beta diversity measures were then related to spatial and environmental gradients in the study system. Important Findings We found that gradients in temperature and potential evapotranspiration have a strong relationship with the phylogenetic alpha diversity in our study system, with phylogenetic overdispersion in low temperatures and phylogenetic clustering at higher temperatures. Further, the phylogenetic beta diversity between two plots increases with an increasing difference in temperature, whereas annual precipitation was not a significant predictor of community phylogenetic turnover. We also found that the phylogenetic structure of the plots in our study system was related to the degree of seasonal flooding and seasonality in precipitation. In particular, more stressful environments such as dry forests and flooded forests showed phylogenetic clustering. Finally, in contrast with previous studies, we find that phylogenetic beta diversity was not strongly related to the spatial distance separating two forest plots, which may be the result of the importance of the three independent mountain ranges in our study system, which generate a high degree of environmental variation over very short distances. In conclusion, we found that environmental gradients are important drivers of both phylogenetic alpha and phylogenetic beta diversities in these forests over spatial distance. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {Abstract. Plants growing in environments differing in prevailing humidity exhibit variations in traits associated with regulation of water loss, particularly cuticular and stomatal properties. Expansive growth is also typically reduced by low humidity. Nevertheless, there is little evidence in plants for a specific sensor for humidity, analogous to the blue light or phytochrome photoreceptors. The detailed mechanism of the stomatal response to humidity remains unknown. Available data suggest mediation by fluxes of water vapour, with evaporation rate assuming the role of sensor. This implies that stomata respond to the driving force for diffusional water loss, leaf‐air vapour pressure difference. Induction of metabolic stomatal response to humidity may involve signal metabolites, such as abscisic acid, that are present in the transpiration stream. These materials may accumulate in the vicinity of guard cells according to the magnitude and location of cuticular transpiration, both of which could change with humidity. Such a mechanism remains hypothetical, but is suggested to account for feedforward responses in which transpiration decreases with increasing evaporative demand, and for the apparent insensitivity of stomatal aperture in isolated epidermis to epidermal water status. Other responses of plants to humidity may involve similar indirect response mechanisms, in the absence of specific humidity sensors. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents (effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law (alpha 3 beta ¼ gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.},

abstract = {Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land-cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity ($\beta$ sim, $\beta$ Jaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain-dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land-cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country-wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land-cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim: We examined whether variation in species composition of breeding birds and resident butterflies in the Great Basin of North America depended on sampling grain (the smallest resolvable unit of study) and on the relative proximity of sampling units across the landscape. We also compared patterns between the two taxonomic groups with reference to their life-history characteristics. Location: Data for our analyses were collected from 1996 to 2003 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA): the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range. Methods: Data on species composition for both taxonomic groups were collecting using standard inventory methods for birds and butterflies in temperate regions. Data were compiled at three sampling grains, sites (average 12 ha), canyons (average 74 ha) and mountain ranges. For each sampling grain in turn, we calculated similarity of species composition using the Jaccard index. First, we investigated whether mean similarity of species composition among the three ranges differed as a function of the grain size at which data were compiled. Secondly, we explored whether mean similarity of species composition was greater for canyons within the same mountain range than for canyons within different mountain ranges. Thirdly, we examined whether mean similarity of species composition at the site level was different for sites within the same canyon, sites within different canyons in the same mountain range, and sites within canyons in different mountain ranges. We used a Bayesian model to analyse these comparisons. Results: For both taxonomic groups, mean similarity of species composition increased as the sampling grain increased. The effect of spatial grain was somewhat greater for birds than for butterflies, especially when the intermediate sampling grain was compared with the smallest sampling grain. Similarity of species composition of butterflies at each sampling grain was greater than similarity of species composition of birds at the same grain. Mean similarity of species composition of both birds and butterflies at the canyon level and site level was affected by relative proximity of sampling locations; beta diversity increased as the relative isolation of sampling locations increased. Main conclusions: The sensitivity of beta diversity to sampling grain likely reflects the effect of local environmental heterogeneity: as sampling grain increases, biotic assemblages appear more homogeneous. Although breeding birds in our study system have larger home ranges than resident butterflies, birds may have more specialized resource requirements related to vegetation structure and composition, especially at small sampling scales. The degree of variation in species composition of both taxonomic groups suggests that spatially extensive sampling will be more effective for drawing inferences about regional patterns of species diversity than intensive sampling at relatively few, smaller sites.},

These natural changes track environmental conditions, and reflect ecological and evolutionary processes. However, anthropogenic activities, including overexploitation, habitat loss and climate change, are currently causing profound transformations in ecosystems and unprecedented loss of biological diversity.

abstract = {Plant species diversity is an important metric of ecosystem functioning, but field assessments of diversity are constrained in number and spatial extent by labor and other expenses. We tested the utility of using spatial heterogeneity in the remotely-sensed reflectance spectrum of grassland canopies to model both spatial turnover in species composition and abundances ($\beta$ diversity) and species diversity at aggregate spatial scales ($\gamma$ diversity). Shannon indices of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ diversity were calculated from field measurements of the number and relative abundances of plant species at each of two spatial grains (0.45 m2 and 35.2 m2) in mesic grasslands in central Texas, USA. Spectral signatures of reflected radiation at each grain were measured from ground-level or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models explained 59-85% of variance in $\gamma$ diversity and 68-79% of variance in $\beta$ diversity using spatial heterogeneity in canopy optical properties. Variation in both $\gamma$ and $\beta$ diversity were associated most strongly with heterogeneity in reflectance in blue (350-370 nm), red (660-770 nm), and near infrared (810-1050 nm) wavebands. Modeled diversity was more sensitive by a factor of three to a given level of spectral heterogeneity when derived from data collected at the small than larger spatial grain. As estimated from calibrated PLSR models, $\beta$ diversity was greater, but $\gamma$ diversity was smaller for restored grassland on a lowland clay than upland silty clay soil. Both $\gamma$ and $\beta$ diversity of grassland can be modeled by using spatial heterogeneity in vegetation optical properties provided that the grain of reflectance measurements is conserved.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships in ecology and conservation, relatively little is known about how BEF relationships change across spatial scales. Theory predicts that change in BEF relationships with increasing spatial scale will depend on variation in species composition across space ($\beta$-diversity), but empirical evidence for this is limited. Moreover, studies have not quantified the direct and indirect role the environment plays in costructuring ecosystem functioning across spatial scales. We used 14 temperate-forest plots 1.4 ha in size containing 18,323 trees to quantify scale-dependence between aboveground tree biomass and three components of tree-species diversity—$\alpha$-diversity (average local diversity), $\gamma$-diversity (total diversity), and $\beta$-diversity. Using structural-equation models, we quantified the direct effects of each diversity component and the environment (soil nutrients and topography), as well as indirect effects of the environment, on tree biomass across 11 spatial extents ranging from 400 to 14,400 m2. Our results show that the relationship between $\beta$-diversity and tree biomass strengthened with increasing spatial extent. Moreover, $\beta$-diversity appeared to be a stronger predictor of biomass than $\alpha$-diversity and $\gamma$-diversity at intermediate to large spatial extents. The environment had strong direct and indirect effects on biomass, but, in contrast to diversity, these effects did not strengthen with increasing spatial extent. This study provides some of the first empirical evidence that $\beta$-diversity underpins the scaling of BEF relationships in naturally complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {Aim: A key aspect of biodiversity research is to determine the environmental drivers affecting the degree to which ecological assemblages vary in space (beta diversity). The strength and significance of environmental drivers of beta diversity is, however, influenced by the spatial extent over which beta diversity is assessed. Beta diversity of riverine biota is affected by flow variability. We examined hydrology–beta diversity relationships at two spatial extents (reaches vs. entire systems) within rivers to determine if relationships with hydrological variables are scale dependent or generalisable across spatial scales. Location: Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. Taxon: Freshwater fish. Methods: Fish assemblage data were sourced from two monitoring programmes that sampled sites annually during 2014–2019 and spanned either reaches (<100 km) or the broader ‘system' extent (>1000 km) of five tributaries. Beta diversity was examined by calculating pairwise (incidence and abundance) dissimilarities for each year to compare temporal trends in beta diversity. Multi-site dissimilarities were modelled against hydrological variables using beta regression. Results: Inter-annual change in assemblage composition was detected only at the extent of river reaches but not at the extent of river systems. Temporal variation in within-river beta diversity showed inconsistent patterns when compared between the two spatial extents. Within-river beta diversity relationships with hydrological gradients were inconsistent among rivers. Overall, statistical models explained much more variation in within-river beta diversity when assessed at the reach extent when compared to broader river system extents. Main Conclusions: Our findings highlight that changes in within-river beta diversity are likely to depend on the spatial extent of sampling. Furthermore, inconsistent beta diversity–hydrology relationships among rivers suggest that both empirical evidence and theoretical predictions adopted in ecohydrology may not be transferable among river systems.},

abstract = {The increase of biodiversity from poles to equator is one of the most pervasive features of nature. For 2 centuries since von Humboldt, Wallace, and Darwin, biogeographers and ecologists have investigated the environmental and historical factors that determine the latitudinal gradient of species diversity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The recently proposed metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) aims to explain ecological patterns and processes, including geographical patterns of species richness, in terms of the effects of temperature and body size on the metabolism of organisms. Here we use 2 comparable databases of tree distributions in eastern Asia and North America to investigate the roles of environmental temperature and spatial scale in shaping geographical patterns of species diversity. We find that number of species increases exponentially with environmental temperature as predicted by the MTE, and so does the rate of spatial turnover in species composition (slope of the species-area relationship). The magnitude of temperature dependence of species richness increases with spatial scale. Moreover, the relationship between species richness and temperature is much steeper in eastern Asia than in North America: in cold climates at high latitudes there are more tree species in North America, but the reverse is true in warmer climates at lower latitudes. These patterns provide evidence that the kinetics of ecological and evolutionary processes play a major role in the latitudinal pattern of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Issue: Geodiversity (i.e., the variation in Earth's abiotic processes and features) has strong effects on biodiversity patterns. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of how relationships between biodiversity and geodiversity vary over space and time. Biodiversity data are globally sparse and concentrated in particular regions. In contrast, many forms of geodiversity can be measured continuously across the globe with satellite remote sensing. Satellite remote sensing directly measures environmental variables with grain sizes as small as tens of metres and can therefore elucidate biodiversity–geodiversity relationships across scales. Evidence: We show how one important geodiversity variable, elevation, relates to alpha, beta and gamma taxonomic diversity of trees across spatial scales. We use elevation from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and c. 16,000 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots to quantify spatial scaling relationships between biodiversity and geodiversity with generalized linear models (for alpha and gamma diversity) and beta regression (for beta diversity) across five spatial grains ranging from 5 to 100 km. We illustrate different relationships depending on the form of diversity; beta and gamma diversity show the strongest relationship with variation in elevation. Conclusion: With the onset of climate change, it is more important than ever to examine geodiversity for its potential to foster biodiversity. Widely available satellite remotely sensed geodiversity data offer an important and expanding suite of measurements for understanding and predicting changes in different forms of biodiversity across scales. Interdisciplinary research teams spanning biodiversity, geoscience and remote sensing are well poised to advance understanding of biodiversity–geodiversity relationships across scales and guide the conservation of nature.},

Here, for the first time, we assessed the effects of alpha, beta and gamma diversity on ecosystem stability and the scale dependence of the slope of the diversity–stability relationship. By employing a long-term (33 years) dataset from a temperate grassland, northern China, we calculated the all possible spatial scales with the complete combination from the basic 1-m2 plots. Species richness was positively associated with ecosystem stability through species asynchrony and overyielding at all spatial scales (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m2). Both alpha and beta diversity were positively associated with gamma stability. Moreover, the slope of the diversity–area relationship was significantly higher than that of the stability–area relationship, resulting in a decline of the slope of the diversity–stability relationship with increasing area. Synthesis. With the positive species diversity effect on ecosystem stability from small to large spatial scales, our findings demonstrate the need to maintain a high biodiversity and biotic heterogeneity as insurance against the risks incurred by ecosystems in the face of global environmental changes.},

Several key areas are reviewed in which phylogenetic information helps to resolve long-standing controversies in community ecology, challenges previous assumptions, and opens new areas of investigation. In particular, studies in phylogenetic community ecology have helped to reveal the multitude of processes driving community assembly and have demonstrated the importance of evolution in the assembly process. Phylogenetic approaches have also increased understanding of the consequences of community interactions for speciation, adaptation and extinction. Finally, phylogenetic community structure and composition holds promise for predicting ecosystem processes and impacts of global change. Major challenges to advancing these areas remain. In particular, determining the extent to which ecologically relevant traits are phylogenetically conserved or convergent, and over what temporal scale, is critical to understanding the causes of community phylogenetic structure and its evolutionary and ecosystem consequences.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the role of environmental and dispersal filters is needed to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover of Amazonian tree communities. We compare measures of taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity in 41 one-hectare plots to test the relative importance of climate, soils, geology, geomorphology, pure spatial variables and the spatial variation of environmental drivers of phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover in Ecuadorian Amazon tree communities. We found low phylogenetic and high taxonomic turnover with respect to environmental and dispersal filters. In addition, our results suggest that climate is a significantly better predictor of phylogenetic turnover and taxonomic turnover than geomorphology and soils at all spatial scales. The influence of climate as a predictor of phylogenetic turnover was stronger at broader spatial scales (50 km2) whereas geomorphology and soils appear to be better predictors of taxonomic turnover at mid (5 km2) and fine spatial scales (0.5 km2) but a weak predictor of phylogenetic turnover at broad spatial scales. We also found that the combined effect of geomorphology and soils was significantly higher for taxonomic turnover at all spatial scales but not for phylogenetic turnover at large spatial scales. Geographic distances as proxy of dispersal limitation was a better predictor of phylogenetic turnover at distances of 50 < 500 km. Our findings suggest that climatic variation at regional scales can better predict phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover than geomorphology and soils.},

abstract = {Beta‐diversity has been repeatedly shown to decline with increasing elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because they are confounded by coincident variation in alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity. We used 8795 forest vegetation‐plot records from the Czech National Phytosociological Database to compare the observed patterns of beta diversity to null‐model expectations (beta‐deviation) controlling for the effects of alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity. We tested whether $\beta$‐diversity patterns along a 1200 m elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect of varying species pool size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of community assembly mechanisms determining the distribution of species across communities (e.g. environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null model we used is a novel extension of an existing null‐model designed for presence/absence data and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of community assembly mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed communities such as average species richness and species abundance distribution. Analyses were replicated in ten subregions with comparable elevation ranges. Beta‐diversity declined along the elevation gradient due to a decrease in gamma‐diversity, which was steeper than the decrease in alpha‐diversity. This pattern persisted after controlling for alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity variation, and the results were robust when different resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used. We conclude that in temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta‐diversity with elevation does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size, as has been hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly mechanisms. The results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity measures, thus supporting the use of vegetation‐plot databases for understanding patterns of beta‐diversity at the regional scale.},

abstract = {Aim: Components of scale, such as grain, focus and extent, influence the spatial patterns of alpha and gamma diversity and the relationships between them. We explored these scale relations by testing whether the gamma diversity and alpha diversity along an elevation gradient were related independent of scale and whether the elevational patterns of herbaceous and woody species richness were dependent on scale. Location: Langtang National Park, Nepal. Methods: We estimated alpha diversity (plot richness) for woody and herbaceous plant species along an alpine elevation gradient (3,900–5,000 m a.s.l.) in nested plots of 1 m2, 16 m2 and 100 m2 and gamma diversity (regional richness) from published sources. Generalized linear modelling was used to analyse alpha and gamma diversity and their correspondence at different grain sizes. Results: Elevational trends of gamma and alpha diversity were significantly correlated for both woody and herbaceous species at all grain sizes. The concordance increased with increasing grain size and area for gamma diversity estimation, particularly for the monotonously decreasing elevational gamma and alpha diversity patterns of woody species. The hump-shaped patterns of elevational gamma and alpha diversity for herbaceous species were also significantly correlated, but the concordance between the alpha diversity of herbaceous species and local gamma diversity was stronger. Elevational patterns of alpha diversity were coarsely consistent across grain sizes, although the patterns became more pronounced at larger grain sizes. Main conclusions: The correspondence of elevational gamma and alpha diversity was largely scale invariant, implying that elevational and possibly other geographical diversity patterns can reliably be studied at different spatial scales. Nonetheless, the alpha diversity pattern was the least pronounced at fine grain size, particularly for woody life-forms. This finding suggests that for large-scale patterns such as elevational gradients at regional or continental scales, coarse grain sizes and large areas for gamma estimation are more appropriate.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are highly diverse at many spatial scales. In these forests, small-sized canopy organisms can form species-rich communities already within a few cm2. Understanding how species numbers increase when expanding the sampling along the tree and the forest is critical for evaluating the processes maintaining biodiversity. We therefore studied epiphytic bryophyte diversity in tree crowns and along trunks across spatial scales in a tropical lowland forest in Amazonian Ecuador, sampling bryophytes in 100-cm2 quadrats on 24 trees (15–22 quadrats each) using a spatially hierarchical design, analyzing alpha and beta diversity at different spatial grains and extents. At the smallest grain, tree crowns held more bryophyte species than trunks, but at the largest grain the trunks held most species (93 vs. 77), as beta diversity was higher among trunks than among crowns. However, except for trunks at the largest extent (all 24 trees), the highest beta diversity among quadrats was always found between crowns and trunks. Species turnover strongly dominated beta diversity at all spatial scales. This and the high species richness resulted in highly unpredictable species compositions, especially in trunk communities. These patterns suggest different controls of diversity in crowns than on trunks and an important role for chance processes in shaping these communities. The high beta diversity within trees, in combination with the large effort involved in climbing trees, implies that diversity sampling of small canopy organisms is most efficient using an intensive (many plots on few trees) rather than extensive (many trees across a large area) sampling.

abstract = {Global patterns of regional (gamma) plant diversity are relatively well known, but whether these patterns hold for local communities, and the dependence on spatial grain, remain controversial. Using data on 170,272 georeferenced local plant assemblages, we created global maps of alpha diversity (local species richness) for vascular plants at three different spatial grains, for forests and non-forests. We show that alpha diversity is consistently high across grains in some regions (for example, Andean-Amazonian foothills), but regional ‘scaling anomalies' (deviations from the positive correlation) exist elsewhere, particularly in Eurasian temperate forests with disproportionally higher fine-grained richness and many African tropical forests with disproportionally higher coarse-grained richness. The influence of different climatic, topographic and biogeographical variables on alpha diversity also varies across grains. Our multi-grain maps return a nuanced understanding of vascular plant biodiversity patterns that complements classic maps of biodiversity hotspots and will improve predictions of global change effects on biodiversity.},

abstract = {Questions: Which environmental factors influence fine-grain beta diversity of vegetation and do they vary among taxonomic groups?. Location: Palaearctic biogeographic realm. Methods: We extracted 4,654 nested-plot series with at least four different grain sizes between 0.0001 m² and 1,024 m² from the GrassPlot database, covering a wide range of different grassland and other open habitat types. We derived extensive environmental and structural information for these series. For each series and four taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, all), we calculated the slope parameter (z-value) of the power law species–area relationship (SAR), as a beta diversity measure. We tested whether z-values differed among taxonomic groups and with respect to biogeographic gradients (latitude, elevation, macroclimate), ecological (site) characteristics (several stress–productivity, disturbance and heterogeneity measures, including land use) and alpha diversity (c-value of the power law SAR). Results: Mean z-values were highest for lichens, intermediate for vascular plants and lowest for bryophytes. Bivariate regressions of z-values against environmental variables had rather low predictive power (mean R² = 0.07 for vascular plants, less for other taxa). For vascular plants, the strongest predictors of z-values were herb layer cover (negative), elevation (positive), rock and stone cover (positive) and the c-value (U-shaped). All tested metrics related to land use (fertilization, livestock grazing, mowing, burning, decrease in naturalness) led to a decrease in z-values. Other predictors had little or no impact on z-values. The patterns for bryophytes, lichens and all taxa combined were similar but weaker than those for vascular plants. Conclusions: We conclude that productivity has negative and heterogeneity positive effects on z-values, while the effect of disturbance varies depending on type and intensity. These patterns and the differences among taxonomic groups can be explained via the effects of these drivers on the mean occupancy of species, which is mathematically linked to beta diversity.},

abstract = {Despite two centuries of exploration, our understanding of factors determining the distribution of life on Earth is in many ways still in its infancy. Much of the disagreement about governing processes of variation in species richness may be the result of differences in our perception of species-richness patterns. Until recently, most studies of large-scale species-richness patterns assumed implicitly that patterns and mechanisms were scale invariant. Illustrated with examples and a quantitative analysis of published data on altitudinal gradients of species richness (n = 204), this review discusses how scale effects (extent and grain size) can influence our perception of patterns and processes. For example, a hump-shaped altitudinal species-richness pattern is the most typical (c. 50%), with a monotonic decreasing pattern (c. 25%) also frequendy reported, but the relative distribution of patterns changes readily with spatial grain and extent. If we are to attribute relative impact to various factors influencing species richness and distribution and to decide at which point along a spatial and temporal continuum they act, we should not ask only how results vary as a function of scale but also search for consistent patterns in these scale effects. The review concludes with suggestions of potential routes for future analytical exploration of species-richness patterns.},

A modern resurgence of interests in these elevational clines is likely to contribute important insights for developing a more general theory of species diversity. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of geographical clines in diversity, the research programme for montane biogeography should include statistically rigorous tests of apparent patterns, comparisons of patterns among regions and taxonomic or ecological groups of species, and analyses of clines in environmental variables concurrent with biogeographical surveys. The conceptual framework for this research programme should be based on the assumption that elevational gradients in species diversity result from a combination of ecological and evolutionary processes, rather than the presumed independent effects of one overriding force. Given that montane ecosystems are hot spots of biological diversity, an expanded and integrated programme for biogeographic surveys in montane regions should provide valuable insights for conservation biologists.},

The beta diversity component, which incorporates both alpha and gamma diversity components, is ideal for studying scale issues of diversity. We explore the scale dependency of beta diversity and scale relationship, both theoretically as well as by application to actual data sets. Our results showed that a power law exists for beta diversity-area (spatial grain or spatial extent) relationships, and that the parameters of the power law are dependent on the grain and extent for which the data are defined. Coarse grain size generates a steeper slope (scaling exponent z) with lower values of intercept (c), while a larger extent results in a reverse trend in both parameters. We also found that, for a given grain (with varying extent) or a given extent (with varying grain) the two parameters are themselves related by power laws. These findings are important because they are the first to simultaneously relate the various components of scale and diversity in a unified manner.},

abstract = {Identifying priority areas for biodiversity is essential for directing conservation resources. Fundamentally, we must know where individual species live, which ones are vulnerable, where human actions threaten them, and their levels of protection. As conservation knowledge and threats change, we must reevaluate priorities. We mapped priority areas for vertebrates using newly updated data on >21,000 species of mammals, amphibians, and birds. For each taxon, we identified centers of richness for all species, small-ranged species, and threatened species listed with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Importantly, all analyses were at a spatial grain of 10 × 10 km, 100 times finer than previous assessments. This fine scale is a significant methodological improvement, because it brings mapping to scales comparable with regional decisions on where to place protected areas. We also mapped recent species discoveries, because they suggest where as-yet-unknown species might be living. To assess the protection of the priority areas, we calculated the percentage of priority areas within protected areas using the latest data from the World Database of Protected Areas, providing a snapshot of how well the planet's protected area system encompasses vertebrate biodiversity. Although the priority areas do have more protection than the global average, the level of protection still is insufficient given the importance of these areas for preventing vertebrate extinctions. We also found substantial differences between our identified vertebrate priorities and the leading map of global conservation priorities, the biodiversity hotspots. Our findings suggest a need to reassess the global allocation of conservation resources to reflect today's improved knowledge of biodiversity and conservation.},

abstract = {The relationship between sampled area and the number of species within that area, the species–area relationship (SAR), is a major biodiversity pattern and one of a few law-like regularities in ecology. While the SAR for isolated units (islands or continents) is assumed to result from the dynamics of species colonization, speciation and extinction, the SAR for contiguous areas in which smaller plots are nested within larger sample areas can be attributed to spatial patterns in the distribution of individuals. The nested SAR is typically triphasic in logarithmic space, so that it increases steeply at smaller scales, decelerates at intermediate scales and increases steeply again at continental scales. I will review current theory for this pattern, showing that all three phases of the SAR can be derived from simple geometric considerations. The increase of species richness with area in logarithmic space is generally determined by overall species rarity, so that the rarer the species are on average, the higher is the local slope z. Rarity is scale-dependent: species occupy only a minor proportion of area at broad spatial scales, leading to upward accelerating shape of the SAR at continental scales. Similarly, species are represented by only a few individuals at fine spatial scales, leading to high SAR slope also at small areas. Geometric considerations reveal links of the SAR to other macroecological patterns, namely patterns of $\beta$-diversity, the species–abundance distribution, and the relationship between energy availability (or productivity) and species richness. Knowledge of the regularities concerning nested SARs may be used for standardizing unequal areas, upscaling species richness and estimating species loss due to area loss, but all these applications have their limits, which also follow from the geometric considerations.},

abstract = {Single species forest systems often suffer from low resistance and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree species diversity is discussed as an important management approach to address the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of tree species mixtures remains unknown. We asked whether increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a multi-model simulation experiment under climate change, applying two forest landscape models (iLand and LandClim) across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability of biomass stocks and forest structure. In general, increasing levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive diversity effects increased with increasing severity of climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable effects on temporal stability. Diversity effects were context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps. The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the robustness of our findings. Synthesis and application. Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial scales. ​.},

We find that more specialized caterpillars are locally more abundant than generalists, consistent with a key component of the ‘jack of all trades, master of none' hypothesis. As the diet breadth of species increased, generalists were not as abundant in any one location, but they had broader occupancy across the landscape, which is a pattern that could reflect high plant beta diversity and is consistent with an alternative neutral hypothesis.

The resolution is obscured by lack of data and mismatches in their spatial grain (scale), and by grain-dependent effects of the drivers. Here we introduce cross-scale models integrating global data on tree-species richness from 1,336 local forest surveys and 282 regional checklists, enabling the estimation of drivers and patterns of biodiversity across spatial grains. We uncover grain-dependent effects of both environment and biogeographic regions on species richness, with a striking positive effect of Southeast Asia at coarse grain that disappears at fine grains. We show that, globally, biodiversity cannot be attributed purely to environmental or regional drivers, as the regions are environmentally distinct even within a single latitudinal band. Finally, we predict global maps of biodiversity at local (plot-based) and regional grains, identifying areas of exceptional beta-diversity in China, East Africa and North America. By allowing the importance of drivers of diversity to vary with grain in a single model, our approach unifies disparate results from previous studies regarding environmental versus biogeographic predictors of biodiversity, and enables efficient integration of heterogeneous data.},

abstract = {Ecuador's territory harbors a unique set of species and ecosystems, many of them endemic to the countries' territory and subject to different sources of threat of anthropogenic origin. Despite national and subnational conservation strategies developed in Ecuador to conserve its biodiversity in the long run, including the National System of Protected Areas (PANE) and the forest conservation incentive program SocioBosque (PSB), further actions are needed to mitigate and reverse the effects of threats for the persistence of biodiversity. This study was designed to identify the most important areas for biodiversity conservation in mainland Ecuador that can contribute to preserving key species (i.e. endemic, threatened) and ecosystems in the wider landscape, thus complementing current conservation efforts (i.e. PANE). Species distribution models and recent maps were used to identify a set of 744 species and 87 ecosystems as surrogates of the country's biodiversity. Marxan, a systematic reserve selection algorithm was used to identify important biodiversity areas that could represent between 10% and 20% of the remnant distribution of the surrogates. The optimized solution generated by Marxan included 24% (3.64 million ha) of Ecuador′s remnant vegetation, of which 35% is within the current national protected area system and 13% (456 000 ha) are included within SocioBosque communal and private conservation agreements. Major conservation shortfalls of the PANE were concentrated in the Southern Andes, Central Amazonia, and the Central and Southern portions of the Coastal plain. The incidence of complementary criteria to prioritize conservation strategies, related to climate change, ecosystem conversion, carbon and accessibility, and population density change in relation to the important biodiversity areas was heterogeneous among regions. This confirms the need to implement differentiated conservation and sustainable landscape management strategies. Fourteen priority landscapes were identified based on these important biodiversity areas, including remnant ecosystems considered critical for maintaining large-scale connectivity among regions and preservation of restricted range and threatened species. Further work is needed to expand base information about distribution patterns of biodiversity, improve the representation of endemic and threatened species in conservation strategies, and to fully integrate conservation priorities among a wider set of goals in land use planning exercises at different scales.},
